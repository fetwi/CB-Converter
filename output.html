<h1 id="competitive-tendering-notices">Competitive tendering
notices</h1>
<p>A buyer posts a notice of proposed procurement (NPP) on the tender
opportunities page to advertise a competitive procurement opportunity to
businesses.</p>
<p>An <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> summarizes a solicitation and must include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enough information for businesses to determine their interest and
their ability to fulfill the requirements</p></li>
<li><p>any key conditions for participation (for example, a set-aside
under the Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business, and Canadian
content restrictions)</p></li>
<li><p>a list of the applicable agreements, trade or otherwise</p></li>
<li><p>whether additional material will be either posted on the tender
opportunities page or made available separately</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> should also advise businesses of their option to request a
debriefing.</p>
<p>When entering the point of delivery information on the <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> for a
standing offer or supply arrangement, the buyer must select only those
provinces or territories where deliveries may occur.</p>
<p>Many procurement units have developed templates to assist buyers in
developing <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr>s. Buyers should consult their managers to obtain such
templates.</p>
